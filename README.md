## 📁 Intro to TensorFlow – Project Summaries

1. **`Predicting with a Single Neuron`** – A basic model with one neuron is trained using SGD and MSE to learn a simple linear relationship.

2. **`House Pricing`** – A supervised model predicts house prices using bedroom count, assuming \$50,000 base price and \$50,000 per bedroom.

3. **`Computer Vision`** – An introductory image classification task using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.

4. **`Callback`** – Demonstrates how **callbacks** stop training early when target accuracy or loss is achieved to prevent overfitting.

5. **`Improving Computer Vision Accuracy using Convolutions`** – Introduces **CNNs** with **convolution** and **max pooling** layers for better image classification.

6. **`Exploring Convolution`** – Experiments with various convolutional configurations to study their impact on model accuracy.

7. **`Convolution using real images`**
