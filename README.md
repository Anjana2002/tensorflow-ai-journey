# TensorFlow AI Journey üöÄ

Welcome to my TensorFlow AI Journey!

This repository documents my learning and experiments with TensorFlow, covering foundational concepts in deep learning through hands-on notebooks.

## üß† Technologies Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebooks

## üìÅ  `Intro to Tensorflow`

### 1. `Predicting with a Single Neuron`
A basic model with one neuron is trained using SGD and MSE to learn a linear relationship.



### 2. `House Pricing`
A supervised learning model predicts house prices based on the number of bedrooms, assuming $50,000 base cost and $50,000 per bedroom.


### 3. `Computer vison`
An introductory image classification task using TensorFlow and Keras.

### 4. `Callback`
Demonstrates how callbacks stop training early when target accuracy or loss is reached, preventing overfitting. 


### 5. `Improving Computer Vision Accuracy using Convolutions`
Introduces CNNs with convolution and max pooling layers to improve image classification performance.


### 6. `Exploring convolution`
Experiments with different convolutional layer setups to study their impact on accuracy
